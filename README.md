# Oracle Practice Repo 

# Quickstart
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. `cd` into the project directory (same directory as this `README.md` file)

Now you can run the project:
1. Linux: Use `./start_linux.sh` (Bash Terminal) to execute
2. Windows: Use `./start_windows.ps1` (PowerShell Terminal) to execute

You will add your Perl code/changes to `run.pl`. Database credentials are required (such as Username and Password) to connect, and can also be changed in `run.pl` (I used fake credentials to demonstrate).
